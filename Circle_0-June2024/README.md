## What's Libft

Libft is our own rewrite/implementation of the standard LibC libery/functions + extra functions which would be found in LibC.

## What's in here

### Libft_Original

Libft_Original is the one I actually worked on at the time and was the one I submitted.

### Libft_Modified

Currently there aren't any changes, but the thing is I know my Libft has minor issues which wasn't checked by Moulinette, I want Libft_Modified to be my later improved version of Libft
