# So Long

A 2D game utilising MiniLibX

Working with/Forked from Bjorn

- Work from 2 September 2024

Development goon into stand still, though we did progress a bit before.

We implemented Improved movement and Player Character turning depending on direction.

But right now we have minor memory leaks (which we don't know where it is and the 42-Norminette Line count is out of place

But yeah I still have hopes....

(P.S. Fuck Norminette)
