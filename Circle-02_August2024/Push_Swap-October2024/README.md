# Push_Swap

## A number sorting program written in C

### Stack Sorting Algorithm Implementation

This program implements a stack sorting algorithm known as the Turk Algorithm.
It efficiently sorts a stack of integers using a limited set of operations.
The program processes input, initializes stacks, performs sorting operations
and outputs the sequence of operations used to sort the stack.
