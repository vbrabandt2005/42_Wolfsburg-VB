# Push_Swap

## A number sorting program written in C

### Stack Sorting Algorithm Implementation

This program implements a stack sorting algorithm known as the Turk Algorithm.
It efficiently sorts a stack of integers using a limited set of operations.
The program processes input, initializes stacks, performs sorting operations
and outputs the sequence of operations used to sort the stack.

> Yes, It's painful.

## Usage

- `make` - normal compilation
- `make build` - compilation + visualizor build
- `make visualize` - run visualizor
- `make auto_checker` - run an automatic script which checks counts
- `make clean` && `make fclean` - deleting compiled files
- `make fuck` - delete all compiled files + visualizor files
