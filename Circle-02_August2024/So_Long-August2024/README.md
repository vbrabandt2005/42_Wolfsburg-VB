# So Long

A 2D game utilising [MiniLibX](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux)

Worked with [Grumpyx3](https://github.com/Grumpyx3)

## What we implemented

- Character turning depending on direction
- Enemies (They don't move but yeah they still kill you so still counts)
- Increased Tile size to 120
- Beutiful assets
